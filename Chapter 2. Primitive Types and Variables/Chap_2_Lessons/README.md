In this chapter we will get familiar with primitive types and variables in C# – what they are and how to work with them. First we will consider the data types – integer
types, real types with floating-point, Boolean, character, string and object type. We will continue with the variables, with their characteristics, how to declare them,
how they are assigned a value and what a variable initialization is. We will get familiar with the two major sets of data types in C# – value types and reference types.
Finally we will examine different types of literals and their usage.
