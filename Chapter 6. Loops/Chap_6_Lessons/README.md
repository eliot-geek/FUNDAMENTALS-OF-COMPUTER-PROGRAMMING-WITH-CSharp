In this chapter we will examine the loop programming constructs through which we can execute a code snippet repeatedly. 

We will discuss how to implement conditional repetitions (while and do-while loops) and how to work with for-loops. 

We will give examples of different possibilities to define loops, how to construct them and some of their key usages. 

Finally, we will discuss the foreach-loop construct and how we can use multiple loops placed inside each other (nested loops).
