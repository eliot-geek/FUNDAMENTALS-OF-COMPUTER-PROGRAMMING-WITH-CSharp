In this chapter we will get more familiar with what methods are and why we need to use them. 

The reader will be shown how to declare methods, what parameters are and what a methodâ€™s signature is, how to call a method, how to pass arguments of methods and how methods return values. 

At the end of this chapter we will know how to create our own method and how to use (invoke) it whenever necessary. Eventually, we will suggest some good practices in working with methods. 

The content of this chapter accompanied by detailed examples and exercises that will help the reader practice the learned material.
