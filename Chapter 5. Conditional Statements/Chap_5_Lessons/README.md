In this chapter we will cover the conditional statements in C#, which we can use to execute different actions depending on a given condition. 


We will explain the syntax of the conditional operators if and if-else with suitable examples and explain the practical application of the operator for selection switch-case.


We will focus on the best practices to be followed in order to achieve a better programming style when using nested or other types of conditional statements.
