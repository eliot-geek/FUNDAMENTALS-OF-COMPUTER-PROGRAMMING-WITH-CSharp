In this chapter we will take a look at working with different numeral systems and how numbers are represented in them. 

We will pay more attention to how numbers are represented in decimal, binary and hexadecimal numeral systems, since they are most widely used in computers and programming. 

We will also explain the different ways for encoding numeral data in computers â€“ signed or unsigned integers and the different types of real numbers.
